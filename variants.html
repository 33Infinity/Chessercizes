                                                  this game. The first player to get a Pawn to the
                                                  other side is the winner.</h3>

                                                  Increase difficulty level by adding Kings, playing until checkmate,
                                                  and/or adding any other combination of pieces to the
                                                  Pawns such as Knights only or Kings and Rooks.</h3>

                                             <h3>Coordinating the Pawns is an extremely important skill at any phase of
                                                  the game. Most beginners will trade Pawns as soon
                                                  as the opportunity presents itself, without thinking much about it.
                                                  Instead, prompt your student to consider defending
                                                  their Pawn, or simply pushing it past a proposed trade. In particular,
                                                  focus on the ways a Pawn trade will create the
                                                  ability for other Pawns to run through. For example, if one of your
                                                  Pawns is blocked head-to-head by one of the
                                                  opponent’s, seriously consider attacking their Pawn, so that if they,
                                                  yours will then have an open path to the queening
                                                  square.</h3>

                                             <h3>The addition of Kings significantly complicates the strategy. At the
                                                  end of the game the King is the most powerful piece
                                                  and must be activated. Use the King to attack undefended Pawns, or
                                                  team up with Pawns to double attack the opponent’s
                                                  pawns, or escort a Pawn safely to the queen square. If one side has a
                                                  Queen and King, while the other side has only a
                                                  King, this is usually an automatic win if you know the pattern. A
                                                  majority of games are won using this technique,
                                                  therefore it is traditionally one of the first things taught to new
                                                  chess students. Practice this pattern in the drills

                                                  game of Chess to begin from an entirely unique setup.</h3>

                                             the same: one Bishop must start on a white square and the other Bishop on a dark square. The Kings may still castle as
                                             well, regardless of the placement of the Rooks. This looks confusing at first, but when castling, the Kings will still
                                             land on the same squares as normal, i.e. the white King will land on g1 when castling kingside, or c1 when castling
                                             queenside. The Rooks too will land on their regular spots next to the King on the d-file or f-file, depending on which
                                             side the King castles to. All other regular castling rules apply: no pieces can be placed between the King and Rook, no
                                             castling through check or out of check, and the King and Rook must not have moved before castling.</h3>

                                             the central Pawns to attack key squares and open up lines of movement for the Bishops and Queen. Develop Knights and
                                             Bishops to attack the same squares as the central Pawns. Castle the King behind a safe pawn shield, while also bringing
                                             Rooks to open files, or files where Pawns will be traded. If pieces are not developed, it's like you don't have them! So
                                             make sure you put them on active squares.
